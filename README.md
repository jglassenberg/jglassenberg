### I'm a Product leader in APIs and Developer platforms, with side projects in API tooling.  I'm also a Google Developer Expert and have been working on various Google Apps Scripts.

Current projects include:

- Google Apps Scripts samples, posted to https://github.com/googleworkspace/solutionsand published at https://developers.google.com/apps-script/samples/automations/

- OpenAPI decorator: Endpoint filler.  This takes an OpenAPI schema, parses the models, and appends corresponding CRUD endpoints.  https://github.com/jglassenberg/REST-API-Endpoint-Generator
